## Motivace

<!-- truncate -->

Personally, I am not a big fan of purchasing brand new audio gear for one specific reason - the price.

Why would anyone consider purchasing second-hand audio gear from sites like Reverb.com? Because in your local pawn shops, your dream guitar of specific model in specific color with reasonable price might never appear or at least not in feasible timeline.
